# GameOfLife

This is a basic design of Conway's Game of Life in C# / .NET 5.0 and is intended as a demonstration of coding in C#.
I used Windows forms to keep it simple for a beginning audience.

This project is the basis for a YouTube video series made to show beginners how to write a program in C#.  You can see the series at [https://youtu.be/T2NnHX2HKag](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsmZ4LgYQUkj9JXidoCre5fnVqG4rzQ3).
