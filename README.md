# GameOfLife

This is a basic design of Conway's Game of Life in C# / .NET 5.0 and is intended as a demonstration of coding in C#.
I used Windows forms to keep it simple for a beginning audience.

This project is the basis for a YouTube video made to show beginners how to write a program in C#.  You can see the video at https://youtu.be/T2NnHX2HKag.
